# JQ CLI Wrapper

This is a simple npm wrapper around [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) so it can be pulled in as a
node dependency and used for script commands in the package.json file without the requirement to be
globally installed. While that was my original reason for creating this wrapper, you could install
this globally as another easy way to get jq installed on your system.

**2018 UPDATE!** I rarely use this as a dependency and always install it globally now. Go figure!

This wrapper currently only supports the following jq binaries:

* OS X 64-bit
* Linux 32-bit
* Linux 64-bit

More OS support will be added if needed. Please submit an issue requesting it or feel free to add it
yourself and submit a pull request.

## Usage as package dependency

Just include this as a dependency in your package.json. Once installed you can reference `jq`
directly in the package.json and not need to worry about installing it globally. Here is a basic
contrived example:

```json
{
  "name": "example",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node $(jq -r .main package.json)"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "jq-cli-wrapper": "*"
  }
}
```

## Usage as a global cli tool

```shell
$ npm install --global jq-cli-wrapper
$ jq --version
jq-1.5
```

NOTE: You may need to open a new Terminal window or tab for `jq` to be in your PATH after it is
installed.
